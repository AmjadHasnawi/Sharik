# Sharik
This application helps students to find online teachers with different majors, a student can view any teacher information, rate, or start a video chat after the teacher accepts his/her request. once the chat is finished the student is offered to comment and rate the teacher in order to help future students to choose easily.
This application aims to serve Tawjihi students(High school students) who face hard time to understand specific subjects and YouTube tutorials are not enough for them and the teachers who want to give extra lectures when they are at their home and make some living from this. This will improve the our countries’ education system and improve our children's skills on different subjects. This application also aims to decrease the number of student who fail Tawjihi exam every year.
